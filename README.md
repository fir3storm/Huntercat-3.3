<h3>reNgine 1.1<br>More than just recon!</h3>
<h4>The only web application recon tool you will ever need!</h4>

<p>Quickly discover the attack surface, and identify vulnerabilities using highly customizable and powerful scan engines.
Enjoy peace of mind with reNgine's continuous monitoring, deeper reconnaissance, and open-source powered Vulnerability Scanner.</p>

<h4>What is reNgine?</h4>
<p align="left">reNgine is a web application reconnaissance suite that focuses on a highly configurable streamlined reconnaissance process via engines, reconnaissance data correlation, continuous monitoring, database backed reconnaissance data and a simple yet intuitive user interface. With features such as sub-scan, deeper co-relation, report generation, etc., reNgine aims to fill the gap in traditional reconnaissance tools and is likely to be a better alternative to existing commercial tools.

reNgine makes it easy for penetration testers and security auditors to gather reconnaissance data with minimal configuration.

### reNgine 2.0 codenamed Jasper

I am currently working on reNgine 2.0, which will probably be announced sometime between May and August 2023. reNgine 2.0 will be the most advanced reNgine ever, a lot of work will be done in how scans are performed, things such as Pause and Resume Scan, Axiom Integration, more deeper correlation, Project Options, Multiple Tenants, etc.

Please submit your feature requests via GitHub issues.

## About reNgine

You can watch [reNgine 1.1 release trailer here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy_6F7Vq8Lo) (Recommended)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17223002/164993688-50eb95f2-3653-4ef7-bd3b-ef7a096824ea.jpeg">

reNgine is a web application reconnaissance suite with a focus on a highly configurable, streamlined reconnaissance process. reNgine is backed by a database, with data correlation and organisation, the custom query "like" language for filtering reconnaissance data, reNgine aims to address the shortcomings of the traditional reconnaissance workflow.

The developers behind reNgine understand that reconnaissance data can be huge and manually searching for records to attack can be tedious, so features such as identifying subdomains of interest help penetration testers focus on attack rather than reconnaissance.

reNgine also focuses on continuous monitoring. Penetration testers can choose to schedule the scan at regular intervals and be notified via notification channels such as Discord, Slack and Telegram of any new subdomains or vulnerabilities identified, or any changes to the recon data.

Interoperability is something every reconnaissance tool needs, and reNgine is no different. Starting with reNgine 1.0, we have added features such as import and export of subdomains, endpoints, GF pattern matched endpoints, etc. This allows you to use your favourite reconnaissance workflow in conjunction with reNgine.

PDF reports are something every individual or team needs. From reNgine 1.1, reNgine also comes with the option to download PDF reports. You can also choose the type of report, a full scan report or just a reconnaissance report. We also understand that PDF reports need to be customisable. Choose the colour of the report you want, customise the executive summary, etc. You choose how your PDF report looks!

reNgine features highly configurable scan engines based on YAML, allowing penetration testers to create as many reconnaissance engines of their choice as they like, configure them as they like, and use them against any targets for scanning. These engines allow penetration testers to use the tools of their choice, with the configuration of their choice. Out of the box, reNgine comes with several scan engines such as Full Scan, Passive Scan, Screenshot Gathering, OSINT Engine, etc.

Our focus has always been on finding the right reconnaissance data with the least amount of effort. After several discussions with fellow hackers/pentesters, a screenshot gallery was a must, reNgine also comes with a screenshot gallery, and what's more exciting than having a screenshot gallery with filters, filter screenshots with HTTP status, technology, ports and services.

We also want our fellow hackers to stay ahead of the game, so reNgine also comes with automatic vulnerability reporting (ATM only Hackerone is supported, other platforms may come soon). This allows hackers to define their vulnerability reporting template and reNgine will do the rest of the work to report the vulnerability as soon as it is identified.

## reNgine Bug Bounty Program

[![huntr](https://cdn.huntr.dev/huntr_security_badge_mono.svg)](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyogeshojha%2Frengine)

Security researchers, welcome aboard! I'm excited to announce the reNgine bug bounty programme in collaboration with [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev), which means that you will be rewarded for any vulnerabilities you find in reNgine.

Thank you for your interest in reporting reNgine vulnerabilities! If you are aware of any potential security vulnerabilities in reNgine, we encourage you to report them immediately via [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyogeshojha%2Frengine).

**Please do not disclose vulnerabilities via Github issues/blogs/tweets after/before reporting to huntr.dev as this is explicitly against the disclosure policy of huntr.dev and reNgine and will not be considered for monetary rewards.**

Please note that the reNgine maintainer does not set the bounty amount.
The bounty reward is determined by an industry-first equation developed by huntr.dev to understand the popularity, impact and value of repositories to the open-source community.

**What do I expect from security researchers?**

* Patience: Please note that I am currently the only maintainer in reNgine and it will take some time to validate your report. I ask for your patience during this process.
* Respect for privacy and security reports: Please do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities (including GitHub issues) before or after reporting them on huntr.dev! This is against the disclosure policy and will not be rewarded.
* Respect the rules

**What do you get in return?**

* Thanks from the maintainer
* Monetary rewards
* CVE ID(s)

Please find the [FAQ](https://www.huntr.dev/faq) and [Responsible disclosure policy](https://www.huntr.dev/policy/) from huntr.dev.

## Related Projects

There are many other great reconnaissance frameworks out there, you can use reNgine in conjunction with those tools. But they are great in their own right, and can sometimes produce better results than reNgine.

## Support and Sponsoring

Over the past few years, I have been working hard on reNgine to add new features with the sole aim of making it the de facto standard for reconnaissance. I spend most of my free time and weekends working on reNgine. I do this in addition to my day job. I am happy to have received such overwhelming support from the community. But to keep this project alive, I am looking for financial support.

OR

* Add a [GitHub Star](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine) to the project.
* Tweet about this project, or maybe blogs?
* Maybe nominate me for [GitHub Stars?](https://stars.github.com/nominate/)
* Join DigitalOcean using my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/e353502d19fc) your profit is **$100** and I get $25 DO credit. This will help me test reNgine on VPS before I release any major features.

It takes a considerable amount of time to add new features and make sure everything works. Donating is your way of saying: **reNgine is awesome**.

Any support is greatly appreciated! Thank you!
